            <h2>Patient Center</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What can you expect for your first visit?
                    <br>Most times, if you do not have any dental emergencies, we recommend you to have a full check up. It includes a full set of x-rays, gum evaluation, teeth evaluation and oral cancer screening. Also possibly we can have your cleaning
                    done at the same visit if you do not have any gum disease.</li>
                <li>What paper work do I need?
                    <br>To make your visit much easier, we have online forms for you to fill out. All the information will be transferred to our computer system before you come to our office. All forms are based on ADA guideline, please read carefully before
                    you submit them. You use all or some of the forms.
                    <ol type="a">

                <li>What about dental insurance and copayment? <img src="./public/cards.png" alt=""><img src="./public/carecredit.png" alt=""> 
                    <br>We are in network with almost all major dental insurances including delta dental. So you do not have to file any claims. we will do everything for you!  on the first appointment, we will check your eligibility and coverage for you. Since we are in the network with almost all PPO insurances, your copay will be less than you go to non-network provider. The copayment ususlly is due at the service day, however payment arrangement can be made on case-by-case basis. we take cash, check, credit card and care credit.
                </li>
                <li>How about I do not have any dental insurance? 
                    <br>To serve our community and help as many people as we can, we proposed an in-house discount/insurance plan. It is called AVP membership. Please call for details. It will save you 20%-30% of total cost.
